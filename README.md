# Sholto

DJ software for mixing your own music — a free alternative to Rekordbox and Serato.

**Status:** runs on **Linux** with the **Pioneer DDJ-FLX4** controller today. Windows, macOS, and more controllers are on the way.

Full guide: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) — every button on screen and on the controller.

## What it does

### Your library
- Finds every track in your music folder — **mp3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, and M4A/AAC** — and reads the artist, title, and other tags automatically.
- Shows everything in a sortable list: **Artist · Track · BPM · Key · Time**.
- Analyses each track once and remembers the result, so it's instant every time after.

### Finding and organising
- **Search** — press the spacebar and type. Sholto searches your **tracks, crates, and tags** all at once and shows the top few matches of each, so you can see everything you can jump to.
- **Tags** — label any track with words that matter to you ("peak time", "vocal", "drum & bass"), then filter the whole library down to a tag in one click.
- **Crates** — group tracks into crates (like playlists or record boxes) and jump to a crate's contents instantly. An **All Tracks** crate always holds everything; press **Esc** to get back to it.

### Reading your tracks
- **Automatic beat and tempo detection** — Sholto finds the BPM and marks the downbeats so your beatgrid lines up.
- **Key detection** — every track gets its musical key (with the Camelot code) so you can mix in harmony.
- **Stem separation** — splits a track into its parts (vocals, drums, bass, and the rest) so you can drop out the vocal or bring back the beat, live.
- A small progress bar shows a track being analysed, and a check mark when it's ready.

### Playing and mixing
- **Two decks** you can play, scrub, and mix independently.
- **3-band EQ** on each deck (highs, mids, lows) — cut a band all the way to silence, like a hardware isolator.
- **Filter knob** per deck — sweep from a low-pass to a high-pass for that classic build-up-and-drop feel.
- **Headphone cue** — pre-listen a track in your headphones while the crowd still hears the other deck.
- **Beat loops** — set a loop on the beat and halve or double its length on the fly.
- **Magnetic beat-snap** — when both decks are playing and the beats drift close together, the jog wheel gently "holds" on the beat and both waveforms glow green; let go and the deck locks to the other one's grid. No button to arm — it just happens.
- Pick which speakers or headphones Sholto plays to, and it remembers your choice.

### Seeing your tracks
- **Waveforms coloured by frequency** — deep bass, mids, and highs each get their own colour, and the height shows how intense each moment is, so you can spot the intro, the build-up, the drop, and the breakdown at a glance.
- **Beat-grid markers** along the top, with the downbeats highlighted.
- **A spinning vinyl disc** per deck that turns in time with the track, its ring shading from green to red as the track plays out and flashing near the end.
- **Stem chips** under each disc (drums / vocals / instrumental) — lit when you can hear that part, hollow when it's muted.
- The deck dims red when its volume is all the way down.
- **A range of colour themes** to switch between in Settings.

### Handy moves
- **Fine-tune the beatgrid** — click the BPM on a deck to open a little tuner: nudge the tempo up or down and slide the grid left or right until it lines up with the kicks. There's a one-tap **½ / ×2** for the common case where a slow track is read at twice its real speed, and a reset back to the detected values. Every adjustment is remembered per track.
- **Drop markers** — press **M** to mark the spot you're at on the playing deck so you can find it again.
- **Re-analyse a track** — double-click it (or hold the browse knob on it for about a second) to analyse from scratch — a rescue for the odd track whose beats came out wrong.

## Your DDJ-FLX4
- **Play / pause** and **jog wheels** (top platter to scrub fast, the side ring for fine nudges) on each deck.
- **Channel faders** and the **crossfader** for volume and blending.
- **EQ knobs** (high / mid / low) driving each deck's isolator.
- **The browse knob** scrolls the track list; **LOAD 1 / LOAD 2** load the highlighted track onto a deck.
- **Hot-cue pads** double as **stem mute toggles** — drums, vocals, instrumental — once a track's stems are ready.
- **The CUE buttons** send each deck to your headphones for pre-listening. **Shift + CUE** jumps the track back to the very start instead (keeps playing if it was playing).

Adding support for another controller is straightforward — Sholto keeps each device's button layout in one place.

### Keyboard
- **Space** — open search (type to find tracks, crates, and tags).
- **↑ / ↓** — move up and down the track list.
- **1 / 2** — load the highlighted track onto Deck 1 or Deck 2.
- **Enter** — open the actions menu for the highlighted track (tag it, add it to a crate, or load it).
- **P** — play / pause Deck 1; hold **Shift** for Deck 2.
- **G** — open the beatgrid / tempo tuner on the playing deck; then **↑ / ↓** change the tempo and **← / →** nudge the grid.
- **M** — drop a marker on the playing deck.
- **Esc** — close a menu, or clear a tag/crate filter to go back to **All Tracks**.
- **F11** — toggle fullscreen.

## Install and run

Two ways to get Sholto — grab a ready-made binary, or build it yourself.

### Option 1 — one command (easiest)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freedomfirst26/Sholto/main/get-sholto.sh | bash
```

That downloads the latest release into `~/sholto`, installs the runtime tools it needs (ffmpeg, madmom, and a couple of system libraries — it will ask for your password once), and launches Sholto. Run the same command again later to update. Set `SHOLTO_DIR=/somewhere` to install elsewhere, or add `--no-run` to install without launching:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freedomfirst26/Sholto/main/get-sholto.sh | bash -s -- --no-run
```

Prefer to see what you're running first? Download the script, read it, then `bash get-sholto.sh`.

The binary is **self-contained — you don't need .NET installed.** If you'd rather do it by hand, grab `sholto-*-linux-x64.tar.gz` from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/freedomfirst26/Sholto/releases) page, `tar -xzf` it, run `bash install-deps.sh` once, then `./Sholto.App`.

### Option 2 — build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freedomfirst26/Sholto.git
cd Sholto
bash install.sh
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Sholto.App
```

`install.sh` sets up everything Sholto needs — including .NET and all the tools below — and is safe to re-run. It works on modern Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS, and Debian.

On startup Sholto scans your music folder. Click a track to load it onto Deck 1, or press LOAD 2 on the controller to load it onto Deck 2.

### What it needs

`install.sh` installs all of this for you on Ubuntu / Mint / Pop!_OS / Debian. On another distro, install the equivalents:

**Required**
- **.NET 10** — to build and run Sholto.
- **ffmpeg** — decodes your audio for the beat detector, and also decodes M4A/AAC files for playback.
- **madmom** (the `madmom-onnx` build) — finds the beats and tempo. Sholto can't play a track until it has a beatgrid, so this one isn't optional.
- A normal **Linux desktop** (X11 or Wayland) and a working **sound system** (PipeWire, PulseAudio, or ALSA).

**Optional** — Sholto runs fine without these, you just lose that one feature:
- **demucs** — stem separation (drums / vocals / bass / other). Without it, the stem chips and the hot-cue stem mutes are unavailable.
- **allin1** — AI song-section detection (intro / build / drop / …). Without it, Sholto falls back to a simpler built-in guess.

**Your controller** — a **Pioneer DDJ-FLX4** is picked up automatically when you plug it in; a green dot in the top bar means it's connected (red means reconnect the USB), and it reconnects on its own if it drops. You don't need one — everything works from the mouse and keyboard.
